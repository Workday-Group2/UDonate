## Problem Statement and Description

We want to break the barrier by giving low income college students or adults the ability to receive food donations when they don't have the ability to afford them. We are also fighting food waste by giving the option for others to donate quality food items that might've gone to waste otherwise.

## User Roles and Personas

Include the most up-to-date user roles and personas.
- "receiver": The user is needs assistance with food donation.
- "donater": The user who is posting quality food for others.
- “Donater+receiver” - having the option to play both roles.

Donater: 
- “Carmen is a 25-year-old grad student living in Columbus, Ohio. She notices that every week she ends up throwing out and wasting a lot of her groceries since she cannot finish a lot of it herself. Carmen would like to help fight food waste by finding someone who could use some extra groceries.”

- “Mary and Jenny are roomates living in Los Angeles, California. They both do grocery shopping separately. At the end of the week, Mary and Jenny realize a lot of their groceries are about to expire since they overbought groceries this week. They also cannot finish the food on time. They both dislike wasting food and wish they would give it to someone who needs it”

Receiver:
- “Joe, a student from Texas Tech is currently short on food due to money problems. He doesn't want to go to class on an empty stomach so he can have enough energy to be productive"(Someone in need but still has access to technology).

- “Alicia has multiple kids and she needs help with providing food for her family. She usually surfs the internet on her computer to find websites that can help her find suitable food donators".
