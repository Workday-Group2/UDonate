## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We implemented some stretch features such as a profile picture and star ratings. We also deployed our website this week using heroku and surge.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We had trouble deploying our website because our front end was not connecting to our backend.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished all our tasks.
* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes we used CodePath's deployment guide and codepath tips on presenting demos and slides.
* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 none
