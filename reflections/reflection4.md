# Reflection #4

Pod Members: **Ada Pici, Nasradin Kewden, Esteban Ayala**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Our preparation for our presentation. Getting to meet our pod mates in person. Being able to finish our stretch features on time. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We had a hard time finishing our last stretch features (location filter) but with time and effort, we were able to complete it. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We finish all our tasks in our sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We utilized our mentors for the last touches on our product. We also got perspectives from our other workday podmates. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Nothing at risk :)
