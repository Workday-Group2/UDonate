## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We completed our MVP with all the core features and started the stretch features.
 We were able to get the ratings to display in the backend and finish the password reset feature as well as the location API.
 We were also able to have a great presentation for the end of the week.
 
* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 We had some challenges selecting data using SQL in the backend but we were able to figure it out with the help of collaboration and help from TA's.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished all our tasks for this week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 A resource that helped us a lot this week is utilizing our mentors to fix bugs we were stuck on for a couple of days. We also utilized Yilika's office hours to help us with the backend of viewing booking history.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
 We don't have any features at risk.
